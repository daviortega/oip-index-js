An NPM module containing the query functionalities to run OIP front ends.

## Work in Progress
This section is a work in progress, so more information will be added periotically. Information may be out of data, for latest information, please read the code :)

## Browserify
There is a browserified version of OIP-JS that can be compiled with `npm run browserify`. You can find a demo of how to use the Browserified version inside of the `/demo` folder in this repository. Please note that the compiled bundle provided in the repo may not be the most up to date version. When in doubt, be sure to compile it using the command above for the latest version.

### Modules
Inside of OIP-JS there are currently 11 modules. Each of the 11 modules have specific tasks to try and seperate the logic out. They are seperated as follows:

- Artifact: This contains helper functions for manipulating artifact JSON.
- Comments: This allows the user to simply comment on Artifacts
- Data: This contains simple access to application information that was fetched by the network layer.
- Index: This module provides access to OIPd and pulls data directly from an external OIPd server.
- Network: Usually called by the Data layer. This module contains all of the server calls & network transfer functions (i.e. IPFS).
- OIPd: Provides helper functions for pushing OIPd messages to the Florincoin Blockchain.
- Publisher: Provides helper functions for publishers (i.e. registering a publisher, logging in, etc)
- settings: A simple helper file that allows for easy setting of application settings. This contains most of the URL's to different external services.
- User: Create, Sign-in, Pay, etc. This module provides User functions.
- util: Other generally helpful utility functions that we have found helpful.
- Wallet: This module provides access to `OIPMW` and also has a few wrapper functions. Allows users to Sign messages and send funds easily (along with Login, Logout, and Wallet creation)

Currently, we have implemented or planned the following functions:
